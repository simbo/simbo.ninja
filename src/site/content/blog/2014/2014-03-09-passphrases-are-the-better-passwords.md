title: Passphrases are the better passwords
---
A [study claims](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/service-oriented/passwords-are-the-weakest-link-in-enterprise-it-security-study/8682) that 80% of security incidents were due to weak passwords and about 5% of all passwords are variations of "password".

Why passphrases with random words are better than uber-complicated passwords:

> Security at the expense of usability, comes at the expense of security.

So, choose something you can remember, instead of choosing something you have to write down. But try to be also creative...

Lifehacker explains [how to improve passphrases](http://lifehacker.com/5893510/using-common-phrases-makes-your-passphrase-password-useless-heres-how-to-pick-a-better-phrase) and gives a good overview on various facts and tips on the whole topic.

To store your authentication information and other sensitive data including files, i really recommend [**KeePassX**](https://www.keepassx.org/). I'm using this software for about 10 years now and it's reliable, pattform independent, easy to use and free (like free beer and free speech).

Nevertheless, there may be some people who can remember complicated passwords...
