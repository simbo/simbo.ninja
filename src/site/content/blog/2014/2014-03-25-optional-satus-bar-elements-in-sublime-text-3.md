title: Optional status bar elements in Sublime Text 3
---

Since Sublime Text 3 Build 3057, you have to set some options to show and change encodings or line-endings in the status bar.

```json
{
  "show_encoding": true,
  "show_line_endings": true
}
```

Additionally, the plugin [EncodingHelper](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/EncodingHelper) brings more functions for managing encodings in Sublime.
