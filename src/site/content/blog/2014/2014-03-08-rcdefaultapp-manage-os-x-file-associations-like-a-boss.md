title: RCDefaultApp - Manage OS X file associations like a boss
---

Ever got tired of *"right-click, file-info, open with, change all"* and still not having all files associated with your prefered app?

Get [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/) for free and set file associations depending on your needs quickly once and for all.

This "app" is a preference pane, so place it in `~/Library/PreferencePanes` and find it in your system preferences.

You're welcome.
